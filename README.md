# tictactoe-elisp

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made in elisp and playable in Emacs buffer. This is my modification of Zachary Kanfer's [code](https://zck.org/tictactoe/tictactoe.el) from his Writing Games with Emacs [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk39mp8Vy4M).

This small project helped me to learn basics of elisp and some of the Emacs APIs.

Maybe i will add AI later because right now it is Player on Player only.
